TODO:

- [ ] ctor option: make/do not make backups of ~/.ssh/config

- [ ] Logging mechanism (don't forget a -q option to shut it up)

- [ ] check command: checks each entry against valid ssh option names

- [ ] cleanup - standardizes indentation of subsections.

- [ ] git store/retrieve command: store/retrieve the config file in a
  remote repository. Better: Allow mixing and matching of host groups,
  so you could say "ssh-config git-retrieve work" and it would get
  all the host settings in your "work" group. (This could get heavy
  quickly; it needs config to point it at a git repo, and it just begs
  for an api to administer sections.) For now, YAGNI.

- [ ] "unalias <name>" should be able to remove a primary name,
  provided it has other aliases?

- [x] cp command should take overrides, e.g.
      "cp rails01 srv02 Hostname srv02.example.com User dbrady"

- [x] search mode should highlight search results like ack by wrapping
  them in \033[43m and \033[0m

- [x] unset command: deletes a key/value pair out of a host section

- [x] Capture per-line data, so things like whitespace and comments are
  preserved; this makes the tool friendly to editing the file
  directly.

- [x] copy should copy, then do a replace based on host-nickname. e.g. If
  I have

  Host rails01
      Hostname rails01.example.com

  then "copy rails01 rails02" should copy it and change the Hostname
  to "rails02.example.com".

- [x] backup config file before writing

- [x] gemmify

- [x] wrapper methods, e.g. set! calls [backup, set, save].
